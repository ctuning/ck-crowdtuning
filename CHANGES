* 2016.09.26 * changing 'device' to 'machine'

* 2016.09.23 * major update to support --target ('device' module)

* 2016.09.05 * changed soft functions 'detect' to 'internal_detect' and 'check' to 'detect'

* 2016.07.09 * added UID to specify user, if no user-specified ID or email (to distinguish experiments)

* 2016.06.11 * added support to skip collection of GPU info and force platform scripts

* 2016.05.30 * support for new CK web server

* 2016.03.30 * major update of crowdtuning engine - now using queues!
               Required for Android crowd-tuning app v2.0+!


* 2016.03.29 * adding scenario to user timeline

* 2016.03.16 * adding support for ARM64-based Android mobile devices

* 2016.03.09 * adding beta support for Intel-based Android (x86 and x86_64)

* 2016.03.08 * adding user statistics logging

* 2016.03.07 * adding extra data set tags to select small data sets during collaborative optimization using mobile devices

* 2016.02.22 * major crowdtuning update (cleaned up classification of species) and eviction of old results

* 2016.02.18 * first version of the online classification of the workloads vs distinct optimizations
               aka online learning or active learning (see our CPC'15 paper)

* 2016.02.17 * adding dimension reduction to pipeline 
               (leaving only influential optimizations + inverting and turning off all if needed)
               very important for proper collaborative machine learning
             * changed platform.accelerator -> platform.gpu

* 2016.02.13 * adding flags: llvm,gcc,opencl,bugs to search specific crowdsourcing scenarios
             * starting pruning of solutions (flags, etc)

* 2016.02.12 * adding replay function (still need to add final check/classification of a computational species)
             * added graph of reactions to optimizations

* 2016.02.10 * adding support to crowdtuning arch specific flags 
               (for example, ARM specific flags in GCC and LLVM
                when collaboratively optimizing Android mobile devices)

* 2016.02.09 * adding first LLVM crowdtuning strategies

* 2016.02.05 * various small fixes and enhancements for experiment replay

* 2016.02.04 * adding dependency on repo 'ck-crowdtuning-platforms' 
               to share CPU/GPU/OS/platform feature for collaborative machine learning
             * adding graph of speedups during crowdtuning

* 2016.02.03 * adding ck.type_long for Python2/3 compatibility

* 2016.02.02 * Major engine update with various GCC autotuning scenarios. 
               New crowd-tuning including LLVM/OpenCL is on the way...

* 2016.01.15 * GCC crowd-tuning (up to speed up with margins)
             * Adding repo dependency on ck-web (to visualize results)

* 2016.01.04 * adding submit function from mobile device during crowd-tuning

* 2016.01.02 * adding test function to check CK server from remote (for example from mobile phones when crowdsourcing SW/HW optimization)

* 2015.12.18 * adding dummy modules for compiler flag crowdtuning/pruning and crowdsourcing OpenCL algorithm tuning
